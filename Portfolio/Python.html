<p>Yousef have been working in Python since 2018. He started learning it on teamtreehouse then he headed toward coursera. He intended to use it as backend for building websites in addition to html , css and javascript for the frontend. When he completed the basics , he knew that Python is capable of doing strong tasks in many fields other than websites so, he started using it in his track of learning data science which started in 2019. Since then , he has been learning what is needed to be a data scientist and understanding machine learning which he believes that it is the future of technology.</p>
